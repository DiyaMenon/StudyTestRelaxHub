        <h1>Introduction to Computer Science</h1>

        <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
        <p>A computer is an electronic device that processes data to perform specific tasks. It takes input, processes it according to instructions, and produces meaningful output.</p>

        <h2>Basic Functions of a Computer</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Input:</strong> The computer receives raw data from input devices like a keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone, or camera. This input can be in different formats such as text, images, audio, or video.</li>
            <li><strong>Processing:</strong> The central processing unit (CPU) processes the input data based on predefined instructions. This involves calculations, comparisons, and logical operations necessary to generate the desired output.</li>
            <li><strong>Storage:</strong> The processed data is temporarily stored in **primary memory (RAM)** for quick access. If the data needs to be preserved permanently, it is stored in **secondary storage devices** like hard drives, SSDs, or external USB drives.</li>
            <li><strong>Output:</strong> The processed information is sent to output devices such as monitors, printers, and speakers, allowing users to view or hear the results.</li>
            <li><strong>Control:</strong> The **control unit** of the CPU ensures that all the above functions work in coordination. It regulates data flow between input, processing, storage, and output units.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Computer Buses</h2>
        <p>A **bus** is a communication pathway used to transfer data between different components of a computer.</p>

        <h3>Types of Computer Buses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Bus:</strong> Carries actual data being processed. It is **bidirectional**, meaning it allows data to move in both directions between memory and the CPU.</li>
            <li><strong>Address Bus:</strong> Transmits memory addresses from the CPU to RAM or other devices. It is **unidirectional** (one-way).</li>
            <li><strong>Control Bus:</strong> Sends control signals (e.g., read/write operations) from the CPU to other components.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Memory Unit</h2>
        <p>Memory is an essential component of a computer that stores data and instructions. It is categorized into **primary memory** and **secondary memory**.</p>

        <h3>Primary Memory (Volatile Memory)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> Temporary memory that holds data currently in use. It is erased when the power is off.</li>
            <li><strong>ROM (Read-Only Memory):</strong> Contains essential system instructions and cannot be modified.</li>
            <li><strong>Cache Memory:</strong> High-speed memory located near the CPU for quick data access.</li>
            <li><strong>Registers:</strong> Small storage units inside the CPU that hold instructions and data for processing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Secondary Memory (Non-Volatile Memory)</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hard Disk Drive (HDD):</strong> Stores operating systems, software, and user files. Uses magnetic storage.</li>
            <li><strong>Solid-State Drive (SSD):</strong> Faster than HDDs, uses flash memory with no moving parts.</li>
            <li><strong>Optical Discs (CD/DVD/Blu-ray):</strong> Used for media storage, movies, and software distribution.</li>
            <li><strong>USB Flash Drives:</strong> Portable storage devices that use flash memory.</li>
        </ul>
