## 💡 What Motivated Us?

We’ve all been there — trying to study, but distractions pull us away. Finding notes, switching tabs, or taking random breaks ruins focus. So we thought:

> “What if we had **everything we need in one place** — notes, quizzes, and even relaxing breaks?”

And that’s how **Study Test and Relax Hub** was born.
